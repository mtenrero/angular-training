# Library Management Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Fully functional example deployment

* **Backend:** go to desired backend directory and run: `npm install && node bin/www``. It will listen in http://localhost:3000/books
* **Frontend:** Prebuilt version is available in /dist folder (only in Dynamic project). You can deploy it using any static content web serever (Apache, NginXâ€¦). The easiest way is using *http-serve* npm module with `http-serve .` launching it within /dist folder. **The backend must be listening in `http://localhost:3000/books`**.
